# us_sociodemographic_structures
 
The R code in this repository is used to process data from (Logan et al.'s 2021 Longitudinal 
Tract Data Base)[https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/Researcher/Bridging.htm] into 
neighborhood sociodemographic composite measures such as concentrated disadvantage for the entire United States, 1990â€“2020.
It also produces interpolated year-specific values for linking to life-course panel data such as the PHDCN.

Using this repository requires data from [https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/Researcher/Bridging.htm](https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/Researcher/Bridging.htm). Specifically, you should obtain the "LTDB Standard data set" for both "Full Data" and "Sample" data files for all available years.

See 00_file_paths.R for the expected file paths for the LTDB files.
